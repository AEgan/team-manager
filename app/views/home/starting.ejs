	<h1>Getting Started with TeamManager</h1>

		<p>This is a guide that covers how to use several of the functions that TeamManager provides.</p>

		<br>
		<h2>Create an Account</h2>
		<div class="ui-grid-a">
		    <div class="ui-block-a"><p>In order to use any functionality on the site, you first must make a user account.  Visit <a href="/register"> our registration page</a> to create an account, or go to our <a href="/login">login page</a> to login.  Note that the email you provide will be the one the system sends emails to.</p></div>

		</div>

		<br>
		<h2>Creating a Team</h2>
		<div class="ui-grid-a">
		    <div class="ui-block-a"><p>Once you have logged in, navigate to <a href="/teams"> your teams page</a> that lists all of the teams you and your child are a part of.  If you're just starting out, this page should be empty, so hit the "New Team" button near the bottom to create a new team.</p>
		    <p>After filling in your team's information, you will be taken to a form to fill your new team's roster.  Here, simply enter the first and last name of the player, and the email that you will use to contact them about team events and carpools (this is often their parent's email).  Once you have filled the roster, hit "submit" and you will be taken to your <b>team page</b>, with the players and emails added.
		    </p>

		<h2>Creating an Event</h2>
		<div class="ui-grid-a">
		    <div class="ui-block-a"><p>To create a new event for a team, go to the team's page, go to the "Events" tab, and hit the "Create Event" button.  On the page, pick an event type, set the date, time, and location (valid locations are displayed using Google Maps), as well as any event details.  Once that is submitted, you will be taken to that event page, where you can view the map, see player attendance (once the RSVP), and arrange carpools.</p></div>
